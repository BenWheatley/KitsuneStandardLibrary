# KitsuneStandardLibrary
Standard library of iOS-ObjC code that I have found helpful over the years. The OpenGL stuff no longer works because that API has been deprecated, may update if I get time, otherwise use it as inspiration for lighting effects.

(Now Swift 3 exists, most of this is useless. But I'll re-write the localization stuff in Swift).
